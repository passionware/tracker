# Cube Sidebar: Multi-Dimensional Analytics Panel

## Overview

The sidebar provides a **sophisticated analytical overview** of your data at any zoom level, showing breakdowns across **all available dimensions** simultaneously.

## Features

### 1. üìä Summary Metrics

- **Current level totals**: Shows aggregated measures for the current zoom level
- **Relative progress bars**: Visual comparison between different measures
- **Percentage indicators**: Shows each measure as a percentage of the maximum value

### 2. üîç Multi-Dimensional Exploration

**The game-changer:** Instead of showing only the currently selected breakdown dimension, the sidebar shows **all possible breakdowns simultaneously**.

#### Example Scenario:

**Data:** Sales transactions  
**Available dimensions:** Region, Category, Product, Salesperson  
**Current view:** Breakdown by Region (showing North, South, East, West)

**Traditional approach (old):**

- Sidebar shows: Only Region breakdown

**New approach:**

- Sidebar shows:
  - ‚úÖ **Region** breakdown (4 groups)
  - ‚úÖ **Category** breakdown (3 groups)
  - ‚úÖ **Product** breakdown (12 groups)
  - ‚úÖ **Salesperson** breakdown (8 groups)

### 3. üéØ Interactive Dimension Cards

Each dimension card is **clickable** and shows:

- Dimension name and icon
- Number of unique groups
- Top 5 groups by value (sorted by first measure)
- Visual progress bars
- Active state indicator (checkmark for current breakdown)

**Click behavior:**

- Clicking a dimension card ‚Üí Sets it as the breakdown for children
- Visual feedback: Highlighted border + checkmark when active

### 4. üöÄ Quick Zoom Navigation

Each bar in every breakdown is **clickable** for instant zoom-in:

**Hover effects:**

- Bar gets taller (1px ‚Üí 1.5px)
- Color intensifies (lighter ‚Üí darker indigo)
- ZoomIn icon appears
- Label gets bolder

**Click behavior:**

- Instantly zooms into that specific group
- Builds correct breadcrumb path
- Maintains zoom history

#### Example:

```
Current view: Root (all data)
Sidebar shows: "Category" dimension with bars for:
  - Electronics (45%)  ‚Üê Click this
  - Accessories (30%)
  - Clothing (25%)

Result: Zooms into Electronics, showing its children
```

### 5. üìà Smart Grouping Display

**Top 5 + More:**

- Shows top 5 groups by aggregated value
- Displays "+N more" if there are additional groups
- Sorted by first active measure (e.g., revenue, hours, etc.)

**Percentage calculation:**

- Based on the **current level's total**
- All percentages sum to 100% (for all groups, not just top 5)

### 6. üé® Visual Design

**Color coding:**

- **Active dimension**: Indigo-50 background, indigo-200 ring, indigo-700 text
- **Inactive dimensions**: Hover shows slate-50 background
- **Progress bars**: Gradient from indigo-400 to indigo-600
- **Hover state**: Darker gradient (indigo-500 to indigo-700)

**Spacing:**

- Compact design to fit multiple dimensions
- Scrollable sidebar (max-height: calc(100vh - 2rem))
- 320px width (80 Tailwind units)

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Quick Comparison

**Goal:** Compare how data looks across different dimensions without changing the main view.

**How:**

1. Zoom into any level (e.g., "North" region)
2. Check sidebar to see:
   - Breakdown by Category: Electronics dominates
   - Breakdown by Salesperson: Alice has most sales
   - Breakdown by Product: Laptop Pro is top seller

**Benefit:** Instant insights across multiple perspectives simultaneously.

---

### Use Case 2: Exploratory Navigation

**Goal:** Explore data by jumping between different breakdown paths.

**How:**

1. Start at root
2. Sidebar shows all dimensions
3. Click "Electronics" in Category breakdown ‚Üí Zoom in
4. Sidebar now shows: Product, Salesperson, Region (available for Electronics)
5. Click "Alice Johnson" in Salesperson breakdown ‚Üí Zoom in
6. Continue exploring

**Benefit:** Fluid, non-linear exploration without using main view controls.

---

### Use Case 3: Dimension Discovery

**Goal:** Find which dimension provides the most interesting breakdown.

**How:**

1. Look at all dimension cards in sidebar
2. Compare group counts:
   - Region: 4 groups
   - Category: 3 groups
   - Product: 45 groups (!)
   - Salesperson: 12 groups
3. Click on "Product" to see detailed breakdown
4. Discover that a few products dominate

**Benefit:** Data-driven dimension selection based on actual distribution.

---

### Use Case 4: Quick Drill-Through

**Goal:** Jump directly to a specific data slice without expanding intermediate groups.

**How:**

1. At root level
2. See "Electronics" in Category sidebar (45% of total)
3. Click it ‚Üí Immediately zoom to Electronics
4. See "Laptop Pro" in Product sidebar (70% of Electronics!)
5. Click it ‚Üí Immediately zoom to Laptop Pro
6. Two clicks, two zoom levels

**Benefit:** Fast navigation to areas of interest.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Calculation

```typescript
// For each available dimension at current level:
const grouped = new Map<string, items[]>();
currentItems.forEach((item) => {
  const value = dimension.getValue(item);
  const key = dimension.getKey(value);
  grouped.set(key, [...items]);
});

// Calculate aggregated value for each group
const measure = measures[0]; // Use first measure
const aggregatedValue = measure.aggregate(
  items.map((item) => measure.getValue(item)),
);
```

### Zoom-In Logic

```typescript
onClick={() => {
  // Build breadcrumb for this specific group
  const breadcrumbItem: BreadcrumbItem = {
    dimensionId: dimension.id,
    dimensionValue: dimension.getValue(group.items[0]),
    dimensionKey: group.key,
    label: group.label,
    group: { /* group data */ },
  };

  // Zoom in with full path
  const fullPath = [...zoomPath, breadcrumbItem];
  onZoomIn?.(breadcrumbItem.group, fullPath);
}
```

### Dimension Selection

```typescript
onClick={() => {
  if (zoomPath.length === 0) {
    // Root level
    onDimensionChange?.(dimension.id, 0);
  } else {
    // Zoomed level - set breakdown for current group's children
    const currentBreadcrumb = zoomPath[zoomPath.length - 1];
    const ancestorPath = zoomPath.slice(0, -1);
    onGroupDimensionSelect?.(
      currentBreadcrumb.group,
      dimension.id,
      ancestorPath,
    );
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Calculation Scope

- Only calculates breakdowns for **available dimensions** (excludes ancestors)
- Uses **current level's data** (filtered to zoom level)
- Limits to **top 5 groups** per dimension

### Optimizations

- Uses `Map` for efficient grouping
- Single-pass aggregation per dimension
- No redundant calculations (data already filtered)

### Memory

- Stores minimal data (only top 5 groups per dimension)
- Reuses items from existing groups when possible
- Clears on zoom level change (via React key)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:

1. **Measure selector**: Choose which measure to visualize in breakdowns
2. **Sorting options**: Sort by value, alphabetically, or by count
3. **Expand top N**: User-configurable (show top 3, 5, 10)
4. **Mini sparklines**: Show trends over time for each group
5. **Compare mode**: Select multiple groups to compare side-by-side
6. **Filter from sidebar**: Click to add dimension filters
7. **Export breakdowns**: Download as CSV or image

### UI Improvements:

- Collapsible dimension cards for large datasets
- Search/filter dimension list
- Drag-to-reorder dimensions
- Pin favorite dimensions to top

## Summary

The enhanced sidebar transforms the Cube from a **single-perspective viewer** into a **multi-dimensional analytics dashboard**. Users can:

‚úÖ See all possible data perspectives simultaneously  
‚úÖ Click to switch between breakdown dimensions  
‚úÖ Click bars to zoom into specific groups  
‚úÖ Explore data fluidly without main view changes  
‚úÖ Discover patterns across multiple dimensions at once

**Result:** A powerful, interactive analytics experience that rivals dedicated BI tools! üéâ
